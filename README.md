# A Digital Oscilloscope Based On ATmega328

ATmega328 chip has a rather powerful analog to digital converter. It's a 10 bit resolution successive approximation ADC. Input voltage range is 0 - Vcc. 

For this project, I picked Arduino Nano as the main part of the system. The front end is designed around a LM324 op-amp. Power is supplied by a 9V adapter. It powers the Arduino Nano and LM324. 

In this project, I attempt to run this ADC at its maximum speed. In order to achieve that, there are a few steps to go through. First, ADC is put in free running mode. In this mode, a new conversion starts immediately after the conversion completes. One conversion takes 13 ADC clock cycles.

The 10 bit result generated by ADC is presented ADC Data Register, ADCH and ADCL. Both ADCH and ADCL are 8 bit wide. If less precison is needed, only ADCH is read. An interrupt is triggered when a conversion completes.
